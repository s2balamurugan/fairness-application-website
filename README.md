## Problem Statement and Motivation 
Bias in machine learning models is an issue, especially in areas like incarceration, where decisions can affect an individualâ€™s life. Incarceration data has been shaped by inequalities due to race and socioeconomic states. This results in biased outcomes in predictive models. Addressing this challenge is not just a technical task but a necessity. We aim to incorporate latent variables representing fair decisions to mitigate these biases. We hope to create models that are not only fair but also more interpretable and robust

## What is Latent Variable Modeling?
Latent variable modeling involves the identification and characterization of hidden variables that influence the distribution and outcomes of observed data. These variables are not explicitly provided in the dataset but can be inferred by analyzing patterns and relationships among the observed features. By uncovering latent variables, researchers gain insights into underlying structures and dependencies within the data, enabling more accurate modeling, improved predictions, and a deeper understanding of complex systems.
